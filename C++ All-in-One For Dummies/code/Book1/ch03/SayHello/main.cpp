/*
1. The word cout means you want to write to the console.
2. The << symbols together (with no space between them!) mean the thing that
follows is what you want to write.
3. After the << symbol, you tell the computer what you want to write. It can
either be a string of letters, symbols, and other characters (all inside quotes),
or it can be the word endl.
4. You can put multiple items in a row and have them appear on the console
that way, provided you start the line with cout and precede each item with
the << symbols.
