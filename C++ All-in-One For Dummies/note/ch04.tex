\begin{description}
    \item[Name] Every variable must have a name. In your application, you refer to the variable by this name.
    \item[Type] When you create a variable, you must specify the type of information the variable can hold. After you pick a type for the variable in your application, you can put only things of that type into the variable.
    \item[Value] At any given moment, a variable holds a single value.
