\subsection{Character Types}
Character types store human language data. The six character types are:
\begin{description}
    \item[char] The default type, always 1 byte. May or may not be signed. (Example: ASCII.)
    \item[char16\_t] Used for 2-byte character sets. (Example: UTF-16.)
    \item[char32\_t] Used for 4-byte character sets. (Example: UTF-32.)
    \item[signed char] Same as char but guaranteed to be signed.
    \item[unsigned char] Same as char but guaranteed to be unsigned.
    \item[wchar\_t] Large enough to contain the largest character of the implementation's locale. (Example: Unicode.)
\end{description}
